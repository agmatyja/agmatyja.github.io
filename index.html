   		<h2>[Verse 1:]</h2>
 		<p>It might seem crazy what I’m about to say
		Sunshine she’s here, you can take a break
		I’m a hot air balloon that could go to space
		With the air, like I don’t care baby by the way</p>

		<h2>[Hook:]</h2>
		<p>Because I’m happy
		Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
		Because I’m happy
		Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
		Because I’m happy
		Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
		Because I’m happy
		Clap along if you feel like that’s what you want to do</p>

		<h2>[Verse 2:]</h2>
		<p>Here come bad news talking this and that
		Yeah, give me all you got, don’t hold back
		Yeah, well I should probably warn you I’ll be just fine
		Yeah, no offense to you don’t waste your time
		Here’s why</p>

		<h2>[Hook:]</h2>
		<p>Because I’m happy
		Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
		Because I’m happy
		Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
		Because I’m happy
		Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
		Because I’m happy
		Clap along if you feel like that’s what you want do</p>
		
		<h2>[Bridge:]</h2>
<p>Happy, bring me down.
Can't none, 
Bring me down.
My level's too high,
Bring me down
Can't none,
Bring me down.
I said bring me down
Can't none,
Bring me down
My level's too high, 
Bring me down
Can't none, 
Bring me down
I said</p>

<h2>[Hook:]</h2>
<p>Because I’m happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I’m happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I’m happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I’m happy
Clap along if you feel like that’s what you wanna do</p>
